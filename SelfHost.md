Mai Bot isn't designed to be self-hosted, though people have been forking the repository anyway. So here are the details you need to know in order to run the bot properly.

## Preparations
### 1. Installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
To use discord.js (Mai Bot uses Discord.js to interact with the Discord API), you'll need to install Node.js. 
| ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️|
|:-:|
| If you do have Node installed, but have an older version (i.e. anything below 12.0), you should upgrade to the latest version. Discord.js v12 requires Node 12.0 or higher. |

<br><br>
### 2. Get the project Locally
Run the following commands to get the project locally
```
git clone https://github.com/maisans-maid/Mai.git # or clone your own fork
cd Mai
npm install
npm build
```

<br><br>
### 3. Create a new .env file in the root directory of the project with the following properties:
```
TOKEN=
MONGO=
```
This is also present on .env_example file on the root directory of the project <br>
`TOKEN` should be the bot token obtained from [Discord's developer panel](https://discord.com/developers). <br>
`MONGO` should be your mongo DB password, if you want to use the MONGO Database. You can use the bot without this too, but you won't be able to use [commands](#) that rely on Mongo DB. 

<br><br>
### 4. Start the bot
You can start the bot by typing in `npm start` in the commandline.
<br><br><br>

## Using the Discord.js Client Settings/Parameters
Using the client structure extended from the discord.js client constructor, pass the [Discord.js Client Settings](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/ClientOptions) under the variable `clientSettings`.
```js
//index.js file
//require the extended client constructor
const Client = require('./struct/Client);

//instantiate the new client
const client = new Client({
 //pass in client settings treating it as djs clientOptions
 clientSettings: {
  messageCacheMaxSize: 300
 }
})
```
<br><br><br>

## Hosting Client Settings
Because Mai bot is not designed to be hosted by others, default values for the Client Constructor are not set, which means you need to set them all individually, or the bot will fail to start.
| Parameter | Type | Optional | Default | Description | 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`bootTimeStart` | [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | ❌ | | Sets the Timestamp when the bot started booting up |
|`collections` | [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) <[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)> | ❌ | | Create new collections to be used in the bot. Names in the array will be the collection name. Can be accessed via struct/PersonalizedCollections|
|`commandgroups`| [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) <[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)> | ❌ | | Set the command groups to be included by the bot. Must be identical to folder names inside the commands folder. Excluded folder names will not be loaded. Setting to empty array means no command will be loaded.
|`chatbot` | [Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean) | ❌ | | Enable/Disable the chatbot functionality  |
|`enableDatabase` | [Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean) | ❌ | | Enable/Disable the connection to Database (Will affect database-reliant commands/services) |
|`mongoPassword` | [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | ❌ | | Set the mongo Password. You can also change your connector URI [here](#changing-the-mongo-connector-uri)
|`mongoSettings` | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) <[Mongo Settings](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/connection.html#connection_Connection-openUri)> | ❌ | | Set the Mongo's Connection parameter (if Database is enabled)
|`owners`| [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) <[User ID](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/User?scrollTo=id)> | ❌ | | User IDs that can use the owner-only commands|
|`prefix`| [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | ❌ | | Default bot prefix
|`token` | [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | ❌ | | The Discord Bot Token, grabbed from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
|`uploadchannel` | [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) <[Channel ID](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Channel?scrollTo=id)> | ❌ | | The channel where bot uploads will be made (for `clear` and `eval` commands). This has to be accessible by the bot.

```js
//index.js file
//grab the timestamp at this point
const start = Date.now()

//require the extended client constructor
const Client = require('./struct/Client);

//instantiate the new client
const client = new Client({
 bootTimeStart: start,
 collections: [
   'memes' 
  ],
 commandgroups: [
  'anime',
  'config'
 ],
 chatbot: true,
 enableDatabase: true,
 mongoPassword: process.env.MONGO,
 mongoSettings: {
  useUnifiedTopology : true,
  family: 4
 },
 owners: ['6728456231067891001'],
 prefix: 'm!',
 token: process.env.TOKEN,
 uploadchannel: '6728456221068912001'
})
```
<br><br><br>

## Changing the Mongo connector URI
If you have your own uri, you can change your mongo connector by going to `struct/Mongoose.js` and edit the `connector` variable
```js
//replace the value of this variable inside the mongo constructor

this.connector: //your connector URI

// do not change anything inside this file if you don't know what each variable means and functions as.
