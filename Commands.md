## Removed
Removed Commands are [v2.4.0](https://github.com/maisans-maid/Mai/tree/2.4.0) commands that haven't made its way to the 3.0.0 (latest) update because of some various reasons. They are either WIP (Work-in-Progress) or will be entirely forgotten.
Command | category | Description | Removal Reason | Status |
--------|-------------|----------------|----------|--------|

`nsfw` | anime | Generates a random nsfw image based on the given criteria | No reason at all, just felt it doesn't fit with the bot | ☠️

 - All of the music command from the previous version, [2.4.0](https://github.com/maisans-maid/Mai/tree/2.4.0/commands/music), has been removed due to the hosting limitations of the bot. These commands, however, are almost complete (for the latest version) but will never be pushed unless the bot gets a proper hosting service. If you forked the latest (3.0.0) version and want to use the music feature, feel free to open an issue. I will create a branch for it if someone is interested once it is complete.
